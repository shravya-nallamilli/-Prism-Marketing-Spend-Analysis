# **Prism Marketing Spend Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyses marketing spend across three platforms—Google, Meta, and RTB—to measure ROI and assess the impact of these investments on performance metrics such as clicks, impressions, and total revenue. The goal was to identify the effectiveness of marketing channels and recommend budget reallocation strategies for maximising ROI.

## **Steps and Methodology**

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Gathered marketing spend and performance metrics (clicks, impressions, and revenue) on a monthly basis.
- Organised the data into a structured format in Excel, with one column for each variable.

### **2. Correlation Analysis**
- Conducted correlation analysis to explore the relationship between ad spend and revenue.
- **Key Findings:**
  - **Meta Ad Spend:** Strong positive correlation with revenue (R = 0.731).
  - **Google Ad Spend:** Moderate positive correlation with revenue (R = 0.403).
  - **RTB Ad Spend:** Negligible or negative correlation with revenue (R = -0.005).

### **3. Regression Analysis**
- Ran regression models using Excel’s Data Analysis Toolpak to quantify the impact of each ad channel on total revenue.
- **Key Outputs:**
  - **Meta Ad Spend:** High statistical significance and the strongest predictor of revenue.
  - **Google Ad Spend:** Moderate statistical significance and positive impact on revenue.
  - **RTB Ad Spend:** Minimal to no impact on revenue.

### **4. What-If Analysis**
- Simulated a scenario with a 20% increase in Meta ad spend and a corresponding reduction in Google ad spend.
- Predicted a **4% increase in total annual revenue**, validating the importance of optimising the budget toward high-performing channels.
